1.-piece of data:

A piece of data is the smallest unit of information that is meaningful in a specific context. It represents a single, atomic element of data, such as a number, a character, or a logical value. For example, "42" (a number) or "Juan" (a string) are pieces of data.

2.-data types:

Data types define the kind of data that can be stored and manipulated in a database or programming environment. They determine the type of value (e.g., number, text, date) and the operations that can be performed on that value. Common data types include:

·Integer: Whole numbers (e.g., 10, -5).

·String: Sequences of characters (e.g., "Hello").

·Boolean: True or false values.

·Float: Numbers with decimal points (e.g., 3.14).

·Date/Time: Represent dates and times (e.g., "2024-12-09").

3.-Field: 

A field in a database is a single piece of data or attribute that pertains to a specific entity. It is the smallest unit of information in a database table, representing a column in that 	table.

4.-Primary Key:

A primary key is a unique identifier for a record (row) in a database table. It ensures that each record can be uniquely identified and prevents duplicate entries.

5.-Table:

Is a structured collection of data organized in rows and columns. Each table represents an entity or a concept, and its columns define the attributes or properties of that entity, while each row (also called a record) represents a single instance or data entry of that entity.

Columns (or fields) in a table represent the specific attributes or characteristics of the data. Each column has a defined data type (such as integer, text, date, etc.), and it typically holds data of that type. The columns define the structure of data.
    
Rows (or records) are individual data entries, where each row 	contains specific values for each column.The rows contain the actual data.
    
Primary Key is often defined in a table to uniquely identify each row.Tables are the fundamental building blocks in relational databases (like MySQL, PostgreSQL, and SQL Server), where relationships are established between different tables to store and manage data efficiently.Primary key also uniquely identifies each row.
 
And Foreign Key links tables together (in relational databases).

6.-Query:

Is a request for information or data from a database. Queries are used to retrieve, manipulate, update, or delete data within the database.

A query can be structured in several ways depending on the type of database and the query language used. The most common type is a SQL query (Structured Query Language), which is used for relational databases. 
Characteristics of database query:
·Data Retrieval: Queries are used to fetch specific data from the database based on given conditions (e.g., filtering, sorting).
·Data Modification: Queries can insert, update, or delete data.
	
Different types of query:

·Select Query: Used to retrieve data.

·Insert Query: Used to add new data.

·Update Query: Used to modify existing data.

·Delete Query: Used to remove data. 

7.-Index:

An index is a data structure that improves the speed of data retrieval operations on a database table. It works like a "table of contents" in a book, allowing the system to quickly locate specific rows in a table without having to scan every row.

8.-View:

A view is a virtual table that is based on the result of a query. It doesn't store data itself but provides a way to simplify complex queries or secure data by restricting access to certain rows or columns.

9.-Script:

A script refers to a set of instructions or commands written in a specific language (usually SQL, but sometimes
other languages like Python, Bash, or PowerShell) to automate tasks related to database management.
10.-Procedure:

a procedure refers to a set of precompiled SQL statements that are stored in the database and can
be executed on demand. 
Procedures are used to encapsulate logic and operations that need to be performed on the database, 
allowing you to execute them multiple times without having to rewrite the same code.
The main advantages of using procedures are:

·Improved performance, because the code is precompiled, it can be executed faster.

·Reduction of redundance, thanks to the use of reusable code.

·Security, due to the restriction of the user to the underlaying tables.

11.-Schema (star,snowflake): 

A database schema defines how data is organized within a relational database; this is inclusive of logical constraints such as table names, fields, data types and the relationships between these entities. It is considered the “blueprint” of a database which describes how the data may relate to other tables or other data models. However, the schema does not actually contain data.

Star Schema: 

Star schema is a mature modeling approach widely adopted by relational data warehouses. It requires modelers to classify their model tables as either dimension or fact. The dimensional tables are linked to the fact table. The dimensional tables are built based on problems to be solved and they represent different aspects or perspectives of the data (e.g., time, 	

Snowflake Schema:

While not as widely adopted, the snowflake schema is another organizational structure used in data warehouses. In this case, the fact table is connected to several normalized dimension tables containing descriptive data about the facts in the central fact table. These dimension tables also have child tables. This more complex, branching pattern can resemble a snowflake. Users of a snowflake schema benefit from its low level of data redundancy, but this comes at the cost of slowing query performance.

12.-Snowflake:  

In technological terms, "Snowflake" typically refers to Snowflake Inc., a cloud-based data-warehousing company that provides a platform for data storage, data sharing, and analytics. Snowflake's architecture is designed to handle large-scale data operations in a way that is both scalable and cost-effective, particularly for businesses operating in cloud environments.

13.-Backup: 

The process of copying information or processing status to a redundant system, service, device or medium that can provide the needed processing capability when needed

14.-Database Examples:

MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Oracle Database, SQLite, etc.

The title of "biggest database in the world" can vary depending on the criteria used, such as data volume, number of records, or number of users. Here are a few contenders that are often considered the largest or among the largest databases globally: Google´s Search Index, Facebook´s Users Data, Amazon Web Services (AWS), The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) Data, China's Social Credit System.
