1. Interface in Databases:

In the context of databases, an interface refers to the mechanisms or points of interaction that allow
users or external systems to communicate and work with the database. It abstracts the internal complexity
of the system and provides a simple way to interact with the data.

2. Integrity in Databases:

Integrity in databases is a fundamental concept that ensures the accuracy, consistency, 
and validity of the stored data. It means that data must adhere to certain rules and constraints 
that ensure the information is reliable and coherent. There are several types of integrity in databases:

    -Entity Integrity: Ensures that each row in a table has a unique primary key. 
    This guarantees that each record is unique and there are no duplicates.

    -Referential Integrity: Ensures that relationships between tables remain consistent. 
    This is enforced through foreign keys, which guarantee that a value in one table exists 
    in another related table.

    -Domain Integrity: Ensures that the data in a column belongs to a specific range of values or data type.
     For example, if a column stores ages, it should restrict input to only positive integers.

    -User-Defined or Business Integrity: These are rules that impose custom constraints on the data, 
    based on business requirements. These rules ensure that the data meets certain logical conditions 
    beyond those defined by the database.

3. Integration:

Integration in databases refers to combining data or systems from multiple sources into a unified system, 
enabling them to work together. In database management, this could involve combining data rom different databases,
or integrating a database with other software systems (e.g., through APIs).

4. Metadata:

Metadata is data that describes other data. In databases, metadata provides information about the structure,
organization, and attributes of the data stored in the database. For example, metadata can describe the types of
data in each column of a table, constraints, and relationships between tables. It helps users and systems understand
how to access, use, and manage the data efficiently.
