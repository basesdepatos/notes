-Script:
	A script refers to a set of instructions or commands written in a specific language (usually SQL, but sometimes
	other languages like Python, Bash, or PowerShell) to automate tasks related to database management.
-Procedure:
	a procedure refers to a set of precompiled SQL statements that are stored in the database and can
	be executed on demand. 
	Procedures are used to encapsulate logic and operations that need to be performed on the database, 
	allowing you to execute them multiple times without having to rewrite the same code.
	The main advantages of using procedures are:
		·Improved performance, because the code is precompiled, it can be executed faster.
		·Reduction of redundance, thanks to the use of reusable code.
		·Security, due to the restriction of the user to the underlaying tables.
