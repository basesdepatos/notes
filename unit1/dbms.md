### **ETL _(Extract, Transform, Load)_**

ETL processes collect data from multiple sources, transform it, and load it into a data warehouse for reporting and analysis. Stages include:

- **Extraction:** Copying data from sources like databases (e.g., MySQL, Oracle) or flat files (e.g., CSV).

- **Transformation:** Cleaning and converting data into a usable format.

- **Load:** Moving data into a destination warehouse (e.g., Snowflake).
<br />

## **Programming Languages**

### **PHP**

PHP _(Hypertext Preprocessor)_ is an open-source language primarily used for web development.
<br />It integrates with databases like MySQL for managing data and dynamically displays results on webpages. Popular libraries include Laravel and MySQLi.

### **C++**

C++ is a high-performance, object-oriented language used in software, gaming, and systems programming. While not commonly associated with database management, it can connect to databases via libraries like ODBC.

### **PL/SQL**

PL/SQL _(Procedural Language/Structured Query Language)_ is Oracle's extension of SQL. It combines SQL capabilities with procedural features for tasks like stored procedures, triggers, and error handling, optimizing database operations and ensuring data integrity.
