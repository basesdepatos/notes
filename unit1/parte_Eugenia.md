Schema (star,snowflake): 
A database schema defines how data is organized within a relational database; this is inclusive of logical constraints such as table names, fields, data types and the relationships between these entities. It is considered the “blueprint” of a database which describes how the data may relate to other tables or other data models. However, the schema does not actually contain data.

Star Schema: 
Star schema is a mature modeling approach widely adopted by relational data warehouses. It requires modelers to classify their model tables as either dimension or fact. The dimensional tables are linked to the fact table. The dimensional tables are built based on problems to be solved and they represent different aspects or perspectives of the data (e.g., time, product, location).

Snowflake Schema:
While not as widely adopted, the snowflake schema is another organizational structure used in data warehouses. In this case, the fact table is connected to several normalized dimension tables containing descriptive data about the facts in the central fact table. These dimension tables also have child tables. This more complex, branching pattern can resemble a snowflake. Users of a snowflake schema benefit from its low levels of data redundancy, but this comes at the cost of slowing query performance.

Snowflake:  
In technological terms, "Snowflake" typically refers to Snowflake Inc., a cloud-based data-warehousing company that provides a platform for data storage, data sharing, and analytics. Snowflake's architecture is designed to handle large-scale data operations in a way that is both scalable and cost-effective, particularly for businesses operating in cloud environments.

Backup: 
The process of copying information or processing status to a redundant system, service, device or medium that can provide the needed processing capability when needed

Database Examples: MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Oracle Database, SQLite, etc.
The title of "biggest database in the world" can vary depending on the criteria used, such as data volume, number of records, or number of users. Here are a few contenders that are often considered the largest or among the largest databases globally: Google´s Search Index, Facebook´s Users Data, Amazon Web Services (AWS), The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) Data, China's Social Credit System.
