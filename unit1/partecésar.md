**piece of data:**
A piece of data is the smallest unit of information that is meaningful in a specific context. 
It represents a single, atomic element of data, such as a number, a character, or a logical value. For example, "42" (a number) or "John" (a string) are pieces of data.

**data types:**
Data types define the kind of data that can be stored and manipulated in a database or programming environment. They determine the type of value (e.g., number, text, date) and the operations that can be performed on that value. Common data types include:

Integer: Whole numbers (e.g., 10, -5).
String: Sequences of characters (e.g., "Hello").
Boolean: True or false values.
Float: Numbers with decimal points (e.g., 3.14).
Date/Time: Represent dates and times (e.g., "2024-12-09").
