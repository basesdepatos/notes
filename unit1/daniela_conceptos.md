Table is a structured collection of data organized in rows and columns. Each table represents an entity or a concept, and its columns define the attributes or properties of that entity, while each row (also called a record) represents a single instance or data entry of that entity.

	Columns (or fields) in a table represent the specific attributes or characteristics of the data. Each column has a defined data type (such as integer, text, date, etc.), and it typically holds data of that type. The columns define the structure of data.
    
	Rows (or records) are individual data entries, where each row contains specific values for each column.The rows contain the actual data.
    
	Primary Key is often defined in a table to uniquely identify each row.Tables are the fundamental building blocks in relational databases (like MySQL, PostgreSQL, and SQL Server), where relationships are established between different tables to store and manage data efficiently.Primary key also uniquely identifies each row.
 
	And Foreign Key links tables together (in relational databases).

Query is a request for information or data from a database. Queries are used to retrieve, manipulate, update, or delete data within the database.

A query can be structured in several ways depending on the type of database and the query language used. The most common type is a SQL query (Structured Query Language), which is used for relational databases.
Characteristics of database query:
	Data Retrieval: Queries are used to fetch specific data from the database based on given conditions (e.g., filtering, sorting).
	Data Modification: Queries can insert, update, or delete data.
	
Different types of query:

    Select Query: Used to retrieve data.
    Insert Query: Used to add new data.
    Update Query: Used to modify existing data.
    Delete Query: Used to remove data.
