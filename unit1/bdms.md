DBMS EXAMPLES

Oracle: Oracle is a highly robust and feature-rich relational database management system (RDBMS) designed for enterprise-level applications. It is widely used for large-scale, high-performance systems that require scalability, reliability, and advanced features such as security, transaction control, and high availability. Oracle supports complex data models and provides tools for data replication, clustering, and cloud integration. It is known for handling critical business applications and large volumes of data, making it a preferred choice for mission-critical databases in sectors like finance, telecommunications, and government.

MySQL: MySQL is an open-source relational database management system that is widely used for web applications, content management systems, and small- to medium-sized projects. It is known for being lightweight, fast, and easy to use, while still providing robust support for SQL queries, transactions, and indexing. MySQL is often paired with web technologies like PHP and is the core component of the popular LAMP stack (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP/Python). It offers reliable performance, scalability, and data replication features, making it a popular choice for developers seeking an affordable, easy-to-manage database solution.

DB2: DB2 is a robust, flexible, and scalable database management system by IBM, commonly used by enterprises to manage large amounts of structured and unstructured data. It offers advanced optimization, high availability, and disaster recovery features, making it ideal for mission-critical applications. DB2 is primarily used in corporate environments and by organizations needing to manage large datasets, such as those in financial services, e-commerce, healthcare, telecommunications, and government sectors.

BI: BI, also known as Business Intelligence, is a technology-driven process designed to analyze data and deliver actionable information that helps executives, managers, and workers make informed business decisions. BI software became popular in the 1990s, and the development of AI tools has shaped modern BI into a critical business strategy. Its main functions are collecting data from multiple sources and processing it into key findings for presentations or reports. BI tools help businesses identify trends and uncover risks, providing valuable guidance for data-driven strategies. Examples of BI tools used by companies include Microsoft Power BI, Tableau, Looker Studio, Domo, Zoho Analytics, and Sisense.

ETL: ETL stands for Extract, Transform, Load, a powerful process that helps companies collect information and data from different sources to generate reports, analytics, and support decision-making. Business Intelligence tools are often used alongside ETL because of their compatibility. This process is commonly required in industries such as financial services, oil and gas, telecommunications, healthcare, life sciences, and the public sector.
The ETL process has three stages, as its acronym indicates:

Extraction: Data is identified and copied from various sources, including structured and unstructured data. Examples include relational databases (e.g., MySQL, Oracle), flat files (e.g., CSV, JSON), applications (e.g., CRM, ERP), and NoSQL databases (e.g., MongoDB, Cassandra).
Transformation: The data is cleaned, validated, and transformed into a usable format for the target system.
Load: The transformed data is moved to the destination data warehouse (e.g., Snowflake, Amazon Redshift) through full load or incremental updates, in real-time or batch processing.

PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES

PHP: Originally an acronym for "Personal Home Page," PHP now stands for "Hypertext Preprocessor." It is an open-source, general-purpose language mostly used for web development, due to its strong connection with HTML. PHP simplifies HTML code and can manage dynamic content, build websites, and handle databases, making it an excellent choice for server-side scripting, command-line scripting, and desktop app development.
In the context of databases, PHP is often used to manage data within the database—performing operations like inserting, updating, retrieving, and deleting data—by connecting to the database and executing queries. Retrieved data is then dynamically displayed on webpages. PHP interacts with databases using libraries like Laravel and extensions such as MySQLi, which provide functions (e.g., mysqli_connect() or new PDO()) to execute SQL queries and handle results.

C++: C++ is a general-purpose, object-oriented programming (OOP) language that excels in performance, with a wide range of applications including software, games, and systems programming. As a compiled language based on C, it is not commonly used in web development, unlike PHP.
While C++ does not have built-in database interactions, it can connect to databases through connectors and libraries (e.g., ODBC, MySQL), enabling programs to send queries and retrieve data. C++ is suitable for applications that require database connectivity, although this is not its primary use.

PL/SQL: PL/SQL (Procedural Language/Structured Query Language) is Oracle's procedural extension for SQL. It combines SQL's data manipulation capabilities with procedural programming features such as loops, conditions, and exception handling. PL/SQL allows for the creation of complex queries, stored procedures, functions, and triggers that can be executed within the Oracle database to automate tasks, enhance performance, and ensure data integrity.
Key advantages of PL/SQL include:

- Stored procedures and functions
- Triggers
- Data validation
- Batch processing
- Error handling
- Performance optimization
