PHP:

At first the acronym for "Personal Home Page" and now meaning "Hypertext Processor"
PHP is an open-source general purpose language mostly used for web developement, 
due to this it has a strong connection with HTML and its used to simplify HTML code.
It can manage dynamic content, build websites and manage databases which makes it the perfect choice for
Server-side scripting, command-line scripting and desktop app developement compared to its competitors (Python, Java...).

In our specific case (DATABASES) it is often used to mange the data inside the database, inserting,
updating, retrieving and deleting data by connecting to the database and executing queries to manage the stored data,
the retrieved data is then displayed on the webpage rendering it dynamically.

It interacts with these databases via the use of libraries such as Laravel and extensions such as MySQLi
which provide the functions (ex. mysqli_connect() or new PDO()) to execute SQL queries and handle results.


C++:

C++ is a general use OOP programming language that excells in its performance capabilities with a ton of different uses: apps, games systems software...
It's a compiled language based on C which makes it not commonly used in web developement unlike PHP.

C++ does not have built-in database interactions 
but still interacts with data bases by using database connectors and libraries (ODCB, MySQL...) 
which allow programs to send queries to a database and retrieve data.

In our case C++ can be used in apps that require database conectivity but it is not its primary use.
