PHP:

At first the acronym for "Personal Home Page" and now meaning "Hypertext Processor"
PHP is an open-source general purpose language mostly used for web developement, 
due to this it has a strong connection with HTML and its used to simplify HTML code.
It can manage dynamic content, build websites and manage databases which makes it the perfect choice for
Server-side scripting, command-line scripting and desktop app developement compared to its competitors (Python, Java...).

In our specific case (DATABASES) it is often used to mange the data inside the database, inserting,
updating, retrieving and deleting data by connecting to the database and executing queries to manage the stored data,
the retrieved data is then displayed on the webpage rendering it dynamically.

It interacts with these databases via the use of libraries such as Laravel and extensions such as MySQLi
which provide the functions (ex. mysqli_connect() or new PDO()) to execute SQL queries and handle results.


C++:

C++ is a general use OOP programming language that excells in its performance capabilities with a ton of different uses: apps, games systems software...
It's a compiled language based on C which makes it not commonly used in web developement unlike PHP.

C++ does not have built-in database interactions 
but still interacts with data bases by using database connectors and libraries (ODCB, MySQL...) 
which allow programs to send queries to a database and retrieve data.

In our case C++ can be used in apps that require database conectivity but it is not its primary use.

BI:

BI, as known as Busisness Intelligence, is a technology-driven process whose purpose is analyzing data and deliver
actionable information that helps executives, managers and workers make informed busisness decisions. 
The BI software was popularized in the 90s, and the developement of AI tools have shaped the modern BI into a busisness strategy.

Its main functions are collecting data from multiple sources, then processing it into key findings for a presentation or report. BI 
tools help busisness identify trends as well as uncover risks, providing good guidance for data-driven strategies. 

Some examples of BI tools used by companies include: Microsoft Power BI, Tableau, Looker Studio, Domo, Zoho Analytics, Sisense... and so on.

ETL: 

ETL stands for Extract Transform Load, a powerful act of process that helps companies to collect information, data or items from different 
sources, in order to generate reports, analytics, and decision-making. In this working method Busisness Intelligence tools are oftenly used
as it's compatible with ETL. 
These are required in projects such as: finance services, oil and gas, telecommunications, healthcare, life sciences, and public sector.   

The method of operation has three stages, as its acronym says: 
1. Extraction: the data is identified and copied from various sources, including structured and unstructured data. 
For example: Relational databases (e.g., MySQL, Oracle), Flat files (e.g., CSV, JSON),Applications (e.g., CRM, ERP), NoSQL databases (e.g., MongoDB, Cassandra).

2. Transformation: the data is cleaned, validated, and transformed into a usable format for the target system.

3. Load: the transformed data is moved to the destination data warehouse (e.g., Snowflake, Amazon Redshift) , either through a full load or incremental updates, 
in real-time or batch processing.
